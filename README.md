# Welcome to XboxOS!
Xbox os, a reskin of command.com on ms-dos 1.25. I must be bored with life.   
# Legal?  
Of course! The source code for 1.25 has been officially released by Microsoft themselves years ago. I took their stuff and reskinned it.  
# Compiling  
Download the boot disk from the releases tab. Boot into a virtual machine (or an x86 computer) with the boot disk and type ```mk all```. Because `command.com` in the disk has been precompiled, you might need to delete and recompile `command` if you are compiling with `mk all`.
