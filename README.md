# Welcome to XboxOS!
Xbox os, a reskin of command.com on ms-dos 1.25. I must be bored with life.   
# Legal?  
Of course! The source code for 1.25 has been officially released by Microsoft themselves years ago. I took their stuff and reskinned it.  
# Compiling  
Download the boot disk from the releases tab. Boot with the boot disk and type ```mk all```. Stuff should work now.  
# Other sites  
The alternate download site can be found here: https://cleantalk.cf/xboxos  
# Licensing  
GNU GPL 2. No more
